# Builder Pattern

- not all steps have to be executed to create each product
- products of different kind can be created 
- products created don't need follow the same interface
- you can have multiple implementation following the same build steps
  eg. that way you can follow the same steps to build a car and 
      the same steps to build a manual for the car

      same steps or director
      different builders with different implementation

      different products
